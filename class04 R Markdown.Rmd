# This is my new R Markdown file

## This is a my new text file.

  * It's so much fun
  * Is it really though?
  * fact the first: ctrl+alt+i = insert code chunk
  * fact the second: can change the figure height/width in the chunk header section

```{r chunk the first}
fun_seq <- rnorm(100,100,2)
fun_seq2 <- rnorm(100,200,2)
plot(fun_seq, fun_seq2)
```

```{r chunk the second}
summary (fun_seq)
summary (fun_seq2)
```
