# This is my new R Markdown file

  * It's so much fun.
  * This would have been super helpful for my Honours Thesis.
  * *Fact the first*: ctrl+alt+i = insert code chunk
  * *Fact the second*: can change the figure height/width in the chunk header section
  
### Section One:

Walking through tutorial in class Sept 14/2017

```{r chunk the first}
fun_seq <- rnorm(100,100,2)
fun_seq2 <- rnorm(100,200,2)
plot(fun_seq, fun_seq2)
```

```{r chunk the second}
summary (fun_seq)
summary (fun_seq2)
```


### Section Two:

This fun graph was inspired by InstaChaaz

I suggest you take a look at his profile for some laughs: 

(https://www.instagram.com/instachaaz/)

```{r chunk the third}

x <- log(seq(1,20,1))
y <- seq(1,20,1)
plot(x,y, 
     type = "l", 
     xlab = "Instances of profanity screamed across the open office plan", 
     ylab = "Lenght of time I spend continously coding (hr)", 
     main = "Lab life", 
     yaxt='n', 
     xaxt='n')
```
